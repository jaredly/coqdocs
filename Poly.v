(** ** Polymorphic Lists *)

(** Up to this point, we've been working with lists of numbers.
    Of course, interesting programs also need to be able to manipulate
    lists whose elements are drawn from other types -- lists of
    strings, lists of booleans, lists of lists, etc.  We _could_ just
    define a new inductive datatype for each of these, for
    example... *)

Inductive boollist : Type :=
  | bool_nil : boollist
  | bool_cons : bool -> boollist -> boollist.

(** ... but this would quickly become tedious, partly because we
    have to make up different constructor names for each datatype, but
    mostly because we would also need to define new versions of all
    our list manipulating functions ([length], [rev], etc.)  for each
    new datatype definition. *)

(** To avoid all this repetition, Coq supports _polymorphic_
    inductive type definitions.  For example, here is a polymorphic
    list datatype. *)

Inductive list (X:Type) : Type :=
  | nil : list X
  | cons : X -> list X -> list X.

(** This is exactly like the definition of [natlist] from the
    previous chapter, except that the [nat] argument to the [cons]
    constructor has been replaced by an arbitrary type [X], a binding
    for [X] has been added to the header, and the occurrences of
    [natlist] in the types of the constructors have been replaced by
    [list X].  (We can re-use the constructor names [nil] and [cons]
    because the earlier definition of [natlist] was inside of a
    [Module] definition that is now out of scope.) *)

(** What sort of thing is [list] itself?  One good way to think
    about it is that [list] is a _function_ from [Type]s to
    [Inductive] definitions; or, to put it another way, [list] is a
    function from [Type]s to [Type]s.  For any particular type [X],
    the type [list X] is an [Inductive]ly defined set of lists whose
    elements are things of type [X]. *)

(** With this definition, when we use the constructors [nil] and
    [cons] to build lists, we need to tell Coq the type of the
    elements in the lists we are building -- that is, [nil] and [cons]
    are now _polymorphic constructors_.  Observe the types of these
    constructors: *)

Check nil. 
(* ===> nil : forall X : Type, list X *)
Check cons. 
(* ===> cons : forall X : Type, X -> list X -> list X *)

(** (Side note on notation: In .v files, the "forall" quantifier is
    spelled out in letters.  In the generated HTML files, [forall] is
    usually typeset as the usual mathematical "upside down A," but
    you'll see the spelled-out "forall" in a few places.  This is just
    a quirk of typesetting: there is no difference in meaning. *)

(** The "[forall X]" in these types should be read as an
    additional argument to the constructors that determines the
    expected types of the arguments that follow.  When [nil] and
    [cons] are used, these arguments are supplied in the same way as
    the others.  For example, the list containing [2] and [1] is
    written like this: *)

Check (cons nat 2 (cons nat 1 (nil nat))).

(** (We've gone back to writing [nil] and [cons] explicitly here
    because we haven't yet defined the [ [] ] and [::] notations for
    the new version of lists.  We'll do that in a bit.) *)

(** We can now go back and make polymorphic (or "generic")
    versions of all the list-processing functions that we wrote
    before.  Here is [length], for example: *)

Fixpoint length (X:Type) (l:list X) : nat := 
  match l with
  | nil      => 0
  | cons h t => S (length X t)
  end.

(** Note that the uses of [nil] and [cons] in [match] patterns
    do not require any type annotations: we already know that the list
    [l] contains elements of type [X], so there's no reason to include
    [X] in the pattern.  (More formally, the type [X] is a parameter
    of the whole definition of [list], not of the individual
    constructors.  We'll come back to this point later.)

    As with [nil] and [cons], we can use [length] by applying it first
    to a type and then to its list argument: *)

Example test_length1 :
    length nat (cons nat 1 (cons nat 2 (nil nat))) = 2.
Proof. reflexivity.  Qed.

(** To use our length with other kinds of lists, we simply
    instantiate it with an appropriate type parameter: *)

Example test_length2 :
    length bool (cons bool true (nil bool)) = 1.
Proof. reflexivity.  Qed.

(** Let's close this subsection by re-implementing a few other
    standard list functions on our new polymorphic lists: *)

Fixpoint app (X : Type) (l1 l2 : list X) 
                : (list X) := 
  match l1 with
  | nil      => l2
  | cons h t => cons X h (app X t l2)
  end.

Fixpoint snoc (X:Type) (l:list X) (v:X) : (list X) := 
  match l with
  | nil      => cons X v (nil X)
  | cons h t => cons X h (snoc X t v)
  end.

Fixpoint rev (X:Type) (l:list X) : list X := 
  match l with
  | nil      => nil X
  | cons h t => snoc X (rev X t) h
  end.

Example test_rev1 :
    rev nat (cons nat 1 (cons nat 2 (nil nat))) 
  = (cons nat 2 (cons nat 1 (nil nat))).
Proof. reflexivity.  Qed.

Example test_rev2: 
  rev bool (nil bool) = nil bool.
Proof. reflexivity.  Qed.

(* ###################################################### *)
(** *** Type Annotation Inference *)

(** Let's write the definition of [app] again, but this time we won't
    specify the types of any of the arguments. Will Coq still accept
    it? *)

Fixpoint app' X l1 l2 : list X := 
  match l1 with
  | nil      => l2
  | cons h t => cons X h (app' X t l2)
  end.

(** Indeed it will.  Let's see what type Coq has assigned to [app']: *)

Check app'.
Check app.

(** It has exactly the same type type as [app].  Coq was able to
    use a process called _type inference_ to deduce what the types of
    [X], [l1], and [l2] must be, based on how they are used.  For
    example, since [X] is used as an argument to [cons], it must be a
    [Type], since [cons] expects a [Type] as its first argument;
    matching [l1] with [nil] and [cons] means it must be a [list]; and
    so on.

    This powerful facility means we don't always have to write
    explicit type annotations everywhere, although explicit type
    annotations are still quite useful as documentation and sanity
    checks.  You should try to find a balance in your own code between
    too many type annotations (so many that they clutter and distract)
    and too few (which forces readers to perform type inference in
    their heads in order to understand your code). *)

(* ###################################################### *)
(** *** Type Argument Synthesis *)

(** Whenever we use a polymorphic function, we need to pass it
    one or more types in addition to its other arguments.  For
    example, the recursive call in the body of the [length] function
    above must pass along the type [X].  But just like providing
    explicit type annotations everywhere, this is heavy and verbose.
    Since the second argument to [length] is a list of [X]s, it seems
    entirely obvious that the first argument can only be [X] -- why
    should we have to write it explicitly?

    Fortunately, Coq permits us to avoid this kind of redundancy.  In
    place of any type argument we can write the "implicit argument"
    [_], which can be read as "Please figure out for yourself what
    type belongs here."  More precisely, when Coq encounters a [_], it
    will attempt to _unify_ all locally available information -- the
    type of the function being applied, the types of the other
    arguments, and the type expected by the context in which the
    application appears -- to determine what concrete type should
    replace the [_].

    This may sound similar to type annotation inference -- and,
    indeed, the two procedures rely on the same underlying mechanisms.
    Instead of simply omitting the types of some arguments to a
    function, like
      app' X l1 l2 : list X := 
    we can also replace the types with [_], like
      app' (X : _) (l1 l2 : _) : list X :=
    which tells Coq to attempt to infer the missing information, just
    as with argument synthesis.

    Using implicit arguments, the [length] function can be written
    like this: *)

Fixpoint length' (X:Type) (l:list X) : nat := 
  match l with
  | nil      => 0
  | cons h t => S (length' _ t)
  end.

(** In this instance, we don't save much by writing [_] instead of
    [X].  But in many cases the difference can be significant.  For
    example, suppose we want to write down a list containing the
    numbers [1], [2], and [3].  Instead of writing this... *)

Definition list123 := 
  cons nat 1 (cons nat 2 (cons nat 3 (nil nat))).

(** ...we can use argument synthesis to write this: *)

Definition list123' := cons _ 1 (cons _ 2 (cons _ 3 (nil _))).

(* ###################################################### *)
(** *** Implicit Arguments *)

(** If fact, we can go further.  To avoid having to sprinkle [_]'s
    throughout our programs, we can tell Coq _always_ to infer the
    type argument(s) of a given function. *)

Implicit Arguments nil [[X]].
Implicit Arguments cons [[X]].
Implicit Arguments length [[X]].
Implicit Arguments app [[X]].
Implicit Arguments rev [[X]].
Implicit Arguments snoc [[X]].

(* note: no _ arguments required... *)
Definition list123'' := cons 1 (cons 2 (cons 3 nil)).
Check (length list123'').  

(** Alternatively, we can declare an argument to be implicit while
    defining the function itself, by surrounding the argument in curly
    braces.  For example: *)

Fixpoint length'' {X:Type} (l:list X) : nat := 
  match l with
  | nil      => 0
  | cons h t => S (length'' t)
  end.

(** (Note that we didn't even have to provide a type argument to
    the recursive call to [length''].)  We will use this style
    whenever possible, although we will continue to use use explicit
    [Implicit Argument] declarations for [Inductive] constructors. *)

(** One small problem with declaring arguments [Implicit] is
    that, occasionally, Coq does not have enough local information to
    determine a type argument; in such cases, we need to tell Coq that
    we want to give the argument explicitly this time, even though
    we've globally declared it to be [Implicit].  For example, if we
    write: *)

(* Definition mynil := nil. *)

(** If we uncomment this definition, Coq will give us an error,
    because it doesn't know what type argument to supply to [nil].  We
    can help it by providing an explicit type declaration (so that Coq
    has more information available when it gets to the "application"
    of [nil]): *)

Definition mynil : list nat := nil.

(** Alternatively, we can force the implicit arguments to be explicit by
   prefixing the function name with [@]. *)

Check @nil.

Definition mynil' := @nil nat. 

(** Using argument synthesis and implicit arguments, we can
    define convenient notation for lists, as before.  Since we have
    made the constructor type arguments implicit, Coq will know to
    automatically infer these when we use the notations. *)

Notation "x :: y" := (cons x y) 
                     (at level 60, right associativity).
Notation "[ ]" := nil.
Notation "[ x , .. , y ]" := (cons x .. (cons y []) ..).
Notation "x ++ y" := (app x y) 
                     (at level 60, right associativity).

(** Now lists can be written just the way we'd hope: *)

Definition list123''' := [1, 2, 3].

Fixpoint repeat (X : Type) (n : X) (count : nat) : list X :=

(** ** Polymorphic Pairs *)

(** Following the same pattern, the type definition we gave in
    the last chapter for pairs of numbers can be generalized to
    _polymorphic pairs_ (or _products_): *)

Inductive prod (X Y : Type) : Type :=
  pair : X -> Y -> prod X Y.
 
Implicit Arguments pair [[X] [Y]].

(** As with lists, we make the type arguments implicit and define the
    familiar concrete notation. *)

Notation "( x , y )" := (pair x y).

(** We can also use the [Notation] mechanism to define the standard
    notation for pair _types_: *)

Notation "X * Y" := (prod X Y) : type_scope.

(** (The annotation [: type_scope] tells Coq that this abbreviation
    should be used when parsing types.  This avoids a clash with the
    multiplication symbol.) *)

(** A note of caution: it is easy at first to get [(x,y)] and
    [X*Y] confused.  Remember that [(x,y)] is a _value_ built from two
    other values; [X*Y] is a _type_ built from two other types.  If
    [x] has type [X] and [y] has type [Y], then [(x,y)] has type
    [X*Y]. *)

(** The first and second projection functions now look pretty
    much as they would in any functional programming language. *)

Definition fst {X Y : Type} (p : X * Y) : X := 
  match p with (x,y) => x end.

Check @fst.

Definition snd {X Y : Type} (p : X * Y) : Y := 
  match p with (x,y) => y end.

(** The following function takes two lists and combines them
    into a list of pairs.  In many functional programming languages,
    it is called [zip].  We call it [combine] for consistency with
    Coq's standard library. *)
(** Note that the pair notation can be used both in expressions and in
    patterns... *)

Fixpoint combine {X Y : Type} (lx : list X) (ly : list Y) 
           : list (X*Y) :=
  match (lx,ly) with
  | ([],_) => []
  | (_,[]) => []
  | (x::tx, y::ty) => (x,y) :: (combine tx ty)
  end.



(** Indeed, when no ambiguity results, we can even drop the enclosing
    parens: *)

Fixpoint combine' {X Y : Type} (lx : list X) (ly : list Y) 
           : list (X*Y) :=
  match lx,ly with
  | [],_ => []
  | _,[] => []

  end.

(** **** Exercise: 1 star, optional (combine_checks) *)
(** Try answering the following questions on paper and
    checking your answers in coq:

    - What does
        Eval simpl in (combine [1,2] [false,false,true,true]).

(** **** Exercise: 2 stars, recommended (split) *)
(** The function [split] is the right inverse of combine: it takes a
    list of pairs and returns a pair of lists.  In many functional
    programing languages, this function is called [unzip].

    Uncomment the material below and fill in the definition of
    [split].  Make sure it passes the given unit tests. *)

Fixpoint split {X Y: Type} (l : list (X*Y)) : (list X) * (list Y) :=
  match l with
  | [] => ([], [])
  | (a, b)::t => (a::(fst (split t)), b::(snd (split t)))

(** ** Polymorphic Options *)

(** One last polymorphic type for now: _polymorphic options_.
    The type declaration generalizes the one for [natoption] in the
    previous chapter: *)

Inductive option (X:Type) : Type :=
  | Some : X -> option X
  | None : option X.

Implicit Arguments Some [[X]].
Implicit Arguments None [[X]].

(** We can now rewrite the [index] function so that it works
    with any type of lists. *)

Fixpoint index {X : Type} (n : nat)
               (l : list X) : option X :=
  match l with
  | [] => None 
  | a :: l' => if beq_nat n O then Some a else index (pred n) l'

(** * Functions as Data *)

(* ###################################################### *)
(** ** Higher-Order Functions *)

(** Like many other modern programming languages -- including
    all _functional languages_ (ML, Haskell, Scheme, etc.) -- Coq
    treats functions as first-class citizens, allowing functions to be
    passed as arguments to other functions, returned as results,
    stored in data structures, etc.

    Functions that manipulate other functions are often called
    _higher-order_ functions.  Here's a simple one: *)

Definition doit3times {X:Type} (f:X->X) (n:X) : X := 
  f (f (f n)).

(** The argument [f] here is itself a function (from [X] to
    [X]); the body of [doit3times] applies [f] three times to some
    value [n]. *)

Check @doit3times.

(* ###################################################### *)
(** ** Partial Application *)

(** In fact, the multiple-argument functions we have already
    seen are also examples of passing functions as data.  To see why,
    recall the type of [plus]. *)

Check plus.
(* ==> nat -> nat -> nat *)

(** Each [->] in this expression is actually a _binary_ operator
    on types.  (This is the same as saying that Coq primitively
    supports only one-argument functions -- do you see why?)  This
    operator is _right-associative_, so the type of [plus] is really a
    shorthand for [nat -> (nat -> nat)] -- i.e., it can be read as
    saying that "[plus] is a one-argument function that takes a [nat]
    and returns a one-argument function that takes another [nat] and
    returns a [nat]."  In the examples above, we have always applied
    [plus] to both of its arguments at once, but if we like we can
    supply just the first.  This is called _partial application_. *)

(** ** Digression: Currying *)

(** **** Exercise: 2 stars, optional (currying) *)
(** In Coq, a function [f : A -> B -> C] really has the type [A
    -> (B -> C)].  That is, if you give [f] a value of type [A], it
    will give you function [f' : B -> C].  If you then give [f'] a
    value of type [B], it will return a value of type [C].  This
    allows for partial application, as in [plus3].  Processing a list
    of arguments with functions that return functions is called
    _currying_, in honor of the logician Haskell Curry.

    Conversely, we can reinterpret the type [A -> B -> C] as [(A *
    B) -> C].  This is called _uncurrying_.  With an uncurried binary
    function, both arguments must be given at once as a pair; there is
    no partial application. *)

(** We can define currying as follows: *)

Definition prod_curry {X Y Z : Type}
  (f : X * Y -> Z) (x : X) (y : Y) : Z := f (x, y).

(** As an exercise, define its inverse, [prod_uncurry].  Then prove
    the theorems below to show that the two are inverses. *)

Definition prod_uncurry {X Y Z : Type}
  (f : X -> Y -> Z) (p : X * Y) : Z := f (fst p) (snd p).

(** (Thought exercise: before running these commands, can you
    calculate the types of [prod_curry] and [prod_uncurry]?) *)

(** ** Filter *)

(** Here is a useful higher-order function, which takes a list
    of [X]s and a _predicate_ on [X] (a function from [X] to [bool])
    and "filters" the list, returning a new list containing just those
    elements for which the predicate returns [true]. *)

  | h :: t => if test h then h :: (filter test t)

  end.

(** For example, if we apply [filter] to the predicate [evenb]
    and a list of numbers [l], it returns a list containing just the
    even members of [l]. *)

(** ** Anonymous Functions *)

(** It is a little annoying to be forced to define the function
    [length_is_1] and give it a name just to be able to pass it as an
    argument to [filter], since we will probably never use it again.
    Moreover, this is not an isolated example.  When using
    higher-order functions, we often want to pass as arguments
    "one-off" functions that we will never use again; having to give
    each of these functions a name would be tedious.

    Fortunately, there is a better way. It is also possible to
    construct a function "on the fly" without declaring it at the top
    level or giving it a name; this is analogous to the notation we've
    been using for writing down constant lists, natural numbers, and
    so on. *)

    To begin, here is a function that takes a value [x] (drawn from

    [k], and a value [x], and constructs a function that behaves

    it returns [x]. *)

Definition override {X: Type} (f: nat->X) (k:nat) (x:X) : nat->X:=

(* ###################################################### *)
(** ** Inversion *)

(** Recall the definition of natural numbers:
     Inductive nat : Type :=
       | O : nat
       | S : nat -> nat.
    It is clear from this definition that every number has one of two
    forms: either it is the constructor [O] or it is built by applying
    the constructor [S] to another number.  But there is more here than
    meets the eye: implicit in the definition (and in our informal
    understanding of how datatype declarations work in other
    programming languages) are two other facts:

    - The constructor [S] is _injective_.  That is, the only way we can
      have [S n = S m] is if [n = m].

    - The constructors [O] and [S] are _disjoint_.  That is, [O] is not
      equal to [S n] for any [n]. *)

(** Similar principles apply to all inductively defined types: all
    constructors are injective, and the values built from distinct
    constructors are never equal.  For lists, the [cons] constructor is
    injective and [nil] is different from every non-empty list.  For
    booleans, [true] and [false] are unequal.  (Since neither [true]
    nor [false] take any arguments, their injectivity is not an issue.) *)

(** Coq provides a tactic, called [inversion], that allows us to
    exploit these principles in making proofs.
 
    The [inversion] tactic is used like this.  Suppose [H] is a
    hypothesis in the context (or a previously proven lemma) of the
    form
      c a1 a2 ... an = d b1 b2 ... bm
    for some constructors [c] and [d] and arguments [a1 ... an] and
    [b1 ... bm].  Then [inversion H] instructs Coq to "invert" this
    equality to extract the information it contains about these terms:

    - If [c] and [d] are the same constructor, then we know, by the
      injectivity of this constructor, that [a1 = b1], [a2 = b2],
      etc.; [inversion H] adds these facts to the context, and tries
      to use them to rewrite the goal.

    - If [c] and [d] are different constructors, then the hypothesis
      [H] is contradictory.  That is, a false assumption has crept
      into the context, and this means that any goal whatsoever is
      provable!  In this case, [inversion H] marks the current goal as
      completed and pops it off the goal stack. *)

(** The [inversion] tactic is probably easier to understand by
    seeing it in action than from general descriptions like the above.
    Below you will find example theorems that demonstrate the use of
    [inversion] and exercises to test your understanding. *)

(** The inductive proof above fails because we've set up things so
    that the induction hypothesis (in the second subgoal generated by
    the [induction] tactic) is

       [ true = beq_nat n' m -> n' = m ].

     This hypothesis makes a statement about [n'] together with the
     _particular_ natural number [m] -- that is, the number [m], which
     was introduced into the context by the [intros] at the top of the
     proof, is "held constant" in the induction hypothesis.  This
     induction hypothesis is not strong enough to make the induction
     step of the proof go through.

     If we set up the proof slightly differently by introducing just
     [n] into the context at the top, then we get an induction
     hypothesis that makes a stronger claim:

      [ forall m : nat, true = beq_nat n' m -> n' = m ]

     Setting up the induction hypothesis this way makes the proof of

(** ** Using Tactics on Hypotheses *)

(** By default, most tactics work on the goal formula and leave
    the context unchanged.  However, most tactics also have a variant
    that performs a similar operation on a statement in the context.

    For example, the tactic [simpl in H] performs simplification in
    the hypothesis named [H] in the context. *)

Theorem S_inj : forall (n m : nat) (b : bool),
     beq_nat (S n) (S m) = b  ->
     beq_nat n m = b. 
Proof.
  intros n m b H. simpl in H. apply H.  Qed.

(** Similarly, the tactic [apply L in H] matches some
    conditional statement [L] (of the form [L1 -> L2], say) against a
    hypothesis [H] in the context.  However, unlike ordinary
    [apply] (which rewrites a goal matching [L2] into a subgoal [L1]),
    [apply L in H] matches [H] against [L1] and, if successful,
    replaces it with [L2].
 
    In other words, [apply L in H] gives us a form of "forward
    reasoning" -- from [L1 -> L2] and a hypothesis matching [L1], it
    gives us a hypothesis matching [L2].  By contrast, [apply L] is
    "backward reasoning" -- it says that if we know [L1->L2] and we
    are trying to prove [L2], it suffices to prove [L1].  

    Here is a variant of a proof from above, using forward reasoning
    throughout instead of backward reasoning. *)

Theorem silly3' : forall (n : nat),
  (beq_nat n 5 = true -> beq_nat (S (S n)) 7 = true) ->
     true = beq_nat n 5  ->
     true = beq_nat (S (S n)) 7.
Proof.
  intros n eq H.
  symmetry in H. apply eq in H. symmetry in H. 
  apply H.  Qed.

(** Forward reasoning starts from what is _given_ (premises,
    previously proven theorems) and iteratively draws conclusions from
    them until the goal is reached.  Backward reasoning starts from
    the _goal_, and iteratively reasons about what would imply the
    goal, until premises or previously proven theorems are reached.
    If you've seen informal proofs before (for example, in a math or
    computer science class), they probably used forward reasoning.  In
    general, Coq tends to favor backward reasoning, but in some
    situations the forward style can be easier to use or to think
    about.  *)

(** We have seen many examples where the [destruct] tactic is

    _expression_.  We can also do this with [destruct].

    Here are some examples: *)

(** ** The [remember] Tactic *)

(** (Note: the [remember] tactic is not strictly needed until a
    bit later, so if necessary this section can be skipped and
    returned to when needed.) *)

(** We have seen how the [destruct] tactic can be used to
    perform case analysis of the results of arbitrary computations.
    If [e] is an expression whose type is some inductively defined
    type [T], then, for each constructor [c] of [T], [destruct e]
    generates a subgoal in which all occurrences of [e] (in the goal
    and in the context) are replaced by [c].

    Sometimes, however, this substitution process loses information
    that we need in order to complete the proof.  For example, suppose
    we define a function [sillyfun1] like this: *)

Definition sillyfun1 (n : nat) : bool :=
  if beq_nat n 3 then true
  else if beq_nat n 5 then true
  else false.

(** And suppose that we want to convince Coq of the rather
    obvious observation that [sillyfun1 n] yields [true] only when [n]
    is odd.  By analogy with the proofs we did with [sillyfun] above,
    it is natural to start the proof like this: *)

Theorem sillyfun1_odd_FAILED : forall (n : nat),
     sillyfun1 n = true ->
     oddb n = true.
Proof.
  intros n eq. unfold sillyfun1 in eq.
  destruct (beq_nat n 3).
  (* stuck... *)
Admitted.

(** We get stuck at this point because the context does not
    contain enough information to prove the goal!  The problem is that
    the substitution peformed by [destruct] is too brutal -- it threw
    away every occurrence of [beq_nat n 3], but we need to keep at
    least one of these because we need to be able to reason that
    since, in this branch of the case analysis, [beq_nat n 3 = true],
    it must be that [n = 3], from which it follows that [n] is odd.

    What we would really like is not to use [destruct] directly on
    [beq_nat n 3] and substitute away all occurrences of this
    expression, but rather to use [destruct] on something else that is
    _equal_ to [beq_nat n 3].  For example, if we had a variable that
    we knew was equal to [beq_nat n 3], we could [destruct] this
    variable instead.

    The [remember] tactic allows us to introduce such a variable. *)

Theorem sillyfun1_odd : forall (n : nat),
     sillyfun1 n = true ->
     oddb n = true.

  intros n eq. unfold sillyfun1 in eq.

      Now if we do [destruct e3]... *)
   destruct e3.
   (* ... the variable [e3] gets substituted away (it
     disappears completely) and we are left with the same
      state as at the point where we got stuck above, except

(** * Review *)

(** We've now seen a bunch of Coq's fundamental tactics -- enough to
    do pretty much everything we'll want for a while.  We'll introduce
    one or two more as we go along through the next few lectures, and
    later in the course we'll introduce some more powerful
    _automation_ tactics that make Coq do more of the low-level work
    in many cases.  But basically we've got what we need to get work
    done.

    Here are the ones we've seen:

      - [intros]: 
        move hypotheses/variables from goal to context 

      - [reflexivity]:
        finish the proof (when the goal looks like [e = e])

      - [apply]:
        prove goal using a hypothesis, lemma, or constructor

      - [apply... in H]: 
        apply a hypothesis, lemma, or constructor to a hypothesis in
        the context (forward reasoning)

      - [apply... with...]:
        explicitly specify values for variables that cannot be
        determined by pattern matching

      - [simpl]:
        simplify computations in the goal 

      - [simpl in H]:
        ... or a hypothesis 

      - [rewrite]:
        use an equality hypothesis (or lemma) to rewrite the goal 

      - [rewrite ... in H]:
        ... or a hypothesis 

      - [symmetry]:
        changes a goal of the form [t=u] into [u=t]

      - [symmetry in H]:
        changes a hypothesis of the form [t=u] into [u=t]

      - [unfold]:
        replace a defined constant by its right-hand side in the goal 

      - [unfold... in H]:
        ... or a hypothesis  

      - [destruct... as...]:
        case analysis on values of inductively defined types 

      - [induction... as...]:
        induction on values of inductively defined types 

      - [inversion]:
        reason by injectivity and distinctness of constructors

      - [remember (e) as x]:
        give a name ([x]) to an expression ([e]) so that we can
        destruct [x] without "losing" [e]

(** **** Exercise: 4 stars, recommended (forall_exists_challenge) *)
(** Challenge problem: Define two recursive [Fixpoints],
    [forallb] and [existsb].  The first checks whether every
    element in a list satisfies a given predicate:
      forallb oddb [1,3,5,7,9] = true

      forallb negb [false,false] = true
  
      forallb evenb [0,2,4,5] = false
  
      forallb (beq_nat 5) [] = true
    The function [existsb] checks whether there exists an element in
    the list that satisfies a given predicate:
      existsb (beq_nat 5) [0,2,3,6] = false
 
      existsb (andb true) [true,true,false] = true
 
      existsb oddb [1,0,0,0,0,3] = true
 
      existsb evenb [] = false
    Next, create a _nonrecursive_ [Definition], [existsb'], using
    [forallb] and [negb].
 
    Prove that [existsb'] and [existsb] have the same behavior.
